## 🧠 Core Competencies and Key Achievements

This project required intensive research, critical thinking, and a deep application of security frameworks, resulting in the following high-value strategic and technical outputs:

### 1. Strategic Governance and Risk Management (GRC)
| Achievement | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Program Strategy & Frameworks** | Defined the ISP's **Mission, Vision, and Goals** and justified the synthesis of three NIST frameworks: **NIST 800-53** (Control), **NIST CSF** (Program), and **NIST 800-39** (Risk). |
| **Risk Philosophy & Prioritization** | Defined a detailed **Risk Appetite Statement** with a **"No Tolerance"** policy towards unauthorized data access. Identified **Operational Risk (Cloud Misconfigurations)** as the top priority on the **Heatmap**. |
| **BIA & Resilience Targets** | Developed a **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** for the critical ERP System, establishing tight resilience targets: **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours** and **RPO of 12 hours**. |

### 2. Threat Analysis and Incident Response
| Achievement | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Threat Modeling** | Performed a step-by-step analysis of the **AT&T data breach** using the **Cyber Kill Chain** model, mapping the attacker's path from **Reconnaissance** to **Actions on Objectives**. |
| **Incident Response Strategy** | Developed a formal **Incident Response Plan**, defining roles (Internal/External) and establishing strict SLAs, including a **Containment Time of 2 days**. |
| **Security Operations** | Selected and justified an **Internal/Dedicated SOC Model** to maximise organisational control and seamlessly integrate proprietary security solutions. |

### 3. Security Architecture and Compliance
| Achievement | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Secure Design Principles** | Designed a comprehensive **Secure Network Architecture Diagram** for an on-premises ERP system, implementing **Defense-in-Depth** via DMZ, Network Segmentation, and Firewalls. |
| **Control Mapping & Tooling** | Researched and mapped specific security technologies (e.g., CrowdStrike Falcon, Splunk, Tenable) onto the **Cyber Defence Matrix (CDM)**, aligning tools to the **NIST CSF 5 Functions**. |
| **Policy & Regulations** | Drafted a high-level **Data Classification Policy** (Physical, Log, Sensitive Data). Identified required regulations (**GDPR, FISMA, CCPA**) and recommended pursuing **ISO 27001 and SOC 2** certifications. |

## 💡 Key Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Learnings

* **Governance and Strategy Integration:** Learned that a successful security program requires synthesising **multiple frameworks** (NIST CSF, 800-53, 800-39) to link low-level controls to high-level business objectives, demonstrating that governance is inseparable from technical execution.
* **Executive Security Focus:** The design of the **Security Team Organisational Structure** confirmed that the CISO's role is inherently strategic, focused on high-level governance, compliance, and reporting to the Executive Leadership (CEO/CIO/Board).
* **Third-Party Risk is Critical:** The analysis of the AT&T breach using the **Cyber Kill Chain** highlighted that the primary failure point often lies with third-party providers, reinforcing the urgent need for robust supply chain security controls.
* **Quantifying Risk for Action:** The risk assessment process emphasised that risks must be **quantifiable** (e.g., scoring impact and likelihood) to justify mitigation budgets, moving security from theoretical threat modelling to actionable resource allocation.

### Project Insights

* **Security Resilience Metrics:** Establishing clear and measurable Recovery Objectives (RTO of 4 hours, RPO of 12 hours) demonstrated the ability to connect business tolerance for downtime directly to the necessary technical requirements for disaster recovery and incident response efforts.
* **Zero Trust Architecture:** Designing the secure architecture for the ERP system reinforced the principle of **Zero Trust** by implementing multiple internal firewalls and dedicated zones to enforce network segmentation and minimise lateral movement strictly.
* **Policy and Compliance Scope:** Drafting the **Data Classification Policy** confirmed that policies must cover all data lifecycle stages, defining handling, storage, and disposal rules for **Physical, Log, and Sensitive Data**.
* **Control Validation via CDM:** Mapping all selected technologies onto the **Cyber Defence Matrix** (CDM) was essential for validating security coverage, ensuring that every NIST function (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) and every asset type is covered by an appropriate control, eliminating critical security blind spots.

---

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

* **Tool Mapping Complexity:** Mapping a diverse set of technologies to a single model like the Cyber Defence Matrix required critical judgment on which specific NIST function a multi-functional tool (e.g., EDR/SIEM) most significantly contributes to across different asset types.
* **Realistic Risk Scoring:** Moving from theoretical risk to assigning accurate Impact and Likelihood scores for the risk assessment demanded extensive external research into industry breach trends and proprietary data to justify the mitigation focus.
