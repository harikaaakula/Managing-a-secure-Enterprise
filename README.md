## 🧠 Core Competencies and Key Achievements

This project required intensive research, critical thinking, and a deep application of security frameworks, resulting in the following high-value strategic and technical outputs:

### 1. Strategic Governance and Risk Management (GRC)
| Skill Demonstrated | Achievement | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Program Strategy & Alignment** | [cite_start]Defined the ISP's **Mission, Vision, and Goals** [cite: 278, 800] focused on safeguarding security solutions against constant threats. [cite_start]Established three strategic objectives, including enhancing Threat Intelligence and boosting Cloud Security[cite: 280, 802]. | Final Report/Presentation |
| **Framework Selection** | [cite_start]Strategically selected and justified the use of three NIST frameworks: **NIST 800-53** (Control), **NIST CSF** (Program), and **NIST 800-39** (Risk)[cite: 285, 807]. | Final Report |
| **Risk Philosophy** | [cite_start]Defined a detailed **Risk Appetite Statement** [cite: 293, 815] [cite_start]with a **"No Tolerance"** policy towards unauthorized access or theft of sensitive client data[cite: 293, 815]. | Final Report |
| **Critical Risk Prioritization** | [cite_start]Conducted a quantitative Risk Assessment and mapped risks on a **Heatmap** [cite: 311, 829][cite_start], identifying **Operational Risk (Cloud Misconfigurations)** as the top priority [cite: 312, 830] [cite_start]due to Very High Impact[cite: 306, 824]. | Final Report |

### 2. Threat Analysis and Incident Response
| Skill Demonstrated | Achievement | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Threat Modeling** | [cite_start]Performed a step-by-step analysis of the **AT&T data breach** [cite: 335, 853] [cite_start]using the **Cyber Kill Chain** model [cite: 343, 861][cite_start], mapping the attacker's path from **Reconnaissance** to **Actions on Objectives**[cite: 344, 349, 868, 873]. | Final Report/Assets |
| **Business Resilience** | [cite_start]Developed a **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** for the core ERP System [cite: 647][cite_start], establishing a tight **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours** [cite: 662] [cite_start]and **RPO of 12 hours**[cite: 664]. | Final Report |
| **Incident Response Strategy** | [cite_start]Developed a formal **Incident Response Plan** [cite: 588][cite_start], defining team roles (Internal/External) [cite: 590, 597] [cite_start]and establishing strict SLAs, including a **Containment Time of 2 days**[cite: 617]. | Final Report |
| **Security Operations** | [cite_start]Selected and justified an **Internal/Dedicated SOC Model** [cite: 633] [cite_start]to maximize control and seamlessly integrate proprietary security solutions[cite: 636]. | Final Report |

### 3. Security Architecture and Compliance
| Skill Demonstrated | Achievement | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Secure Design Principles** | [cite_start]Designed a comprehensive **Secure Network Architecture Diagram** for an on-premises ERP system [cite: 394, 935][cite_start], implementing **Defense-in-Depth** via DMZ, Network Segmentation, and Perimeter Firewalls[cite: 438, 441]. | Final Report/Assets |
| **Control Mapping & Tooling** | [cite_start]Researched and mapped specific security technologies (e.g., CrowdStrike Falcon [cite: 466, 1004][cite_start], Splunk [cite: 468, 1032][cite_start], Tenable [cite: 458, 994][cite_start]) onto the **Cyber Defense Matrix (CDM)** [cite: 454, 990][cite_start], aligning tools to the **NIST CSF 5 Functions**[cite: 516, 548]. | Final Report/Assets |
| **Policy Drafting** | [cite_start]Drafted a high-level **Data Classification Policy** [cite: 671] [cite_start]defining rules for handling **Physical, Log, and Sensitive Data**[cite: 676, 677, 678]. | Final Report |
| **Compliance & Certification** | [cite_start]Identified required regulations (**GDPR, FISMA, CCPA**) [cite: 566, 570, 575] [cite_start]and recommended pursuing **ISO 27001 and SOC 2** certifications[cite: 582]. | Final Report |
